About
======
Hello! I'm Levent, an Associate Professor at Istanbul Beykent University, [the Department of Political Science and Public Administration](https://iibf.beykent.edu.tr/en/departments/political-science-and-public-administration-turkish).

My current research interest is the politicization in the Turkish senior level bureaucracy. In this framework, I focus on the fluctuations in the patronage appointments in the senior-level bureaucracy between 1983-2023 in Turkey as well as the career backgrounds of bureaucrats.

Having an educational background in political science, public administration and statistics, I am deeply enthusiastic about combining different disciplines and techniques together, namely statistics (statistical methods), public administration studies and AI together. In this manner, for instance, I try to develop algorityms and codes in both Python and R for collecting career data of bureaucracts on internet via web scrapping technique, and try to reach meaningful statistical inferences via appropriate methods.
